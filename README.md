If we were to succeed in reforming school curricula around the world in mathematics and programming in the next few decades (an average expectation perhaps), _TO INCLUDE COMPUTER ALGEBRA_, the school children of the next generation may surmise at how primitive the officers at the ministries of education were, at the time when this article was written, who may still be alive to testify.

To explain the human stories and rationale behind this project, we may trace back to the early school experience of some of our project members.

#### Origin I: the Story of W

In the early 1980s, W, who was in his early teens, encountered the then legendary Apple II, and learned the Logo (turtle graphics) and BASIC programming languages, in a remote town S near Penang, Malaysia, which curiously hosted many multinational manufacturing plants, such as the big 4 -- Intel, HP, Motorola,  Bosch -- ever since the bygone Cold War period, perhaps as an technology outpost of the First World camp.

As such, like many little towns near Penang, the biggest international element in town S are perhaps the employees of these multinational corporations (MNC), and have since become a multi generational phenomenon.

And an out of print algebra text book passed on to W via relatives, printed in India, as was the earlier colonial practice.

Cold War historians might be interested in this period, as W was to live through the 1989 upheavals in China and Soviet Union, and later the birth of European Union, and voted in UK election that ushered in Tony Blair's premiership.

More curiously, W was amongst the first generation of students to study various subjects, including mathematics, in the secondary school in the Malay language, which became the primary instructional language not too long ago, as Malay centric nationalism demanded the government to switch from the original instructional language of English. Incidentally, the then rather young Dr Mahathir, a fellow townsman of W, had just became the Prime Minister of Malaysia, after serving as the Minister of Education for a short time.
