If we were to succeed in reforming school curricula around the world in mathematics and programming in the next few decades (an average expectation perhaps), _TO INCLUDE COMPUTER ALGEBRA_, the school children of the next generation may surmise at how primitive the officers at the ministries of education were, at the time when this article was written, who may still be alive to testify.

To explain the human stories and rationale behind this project, we may trace back to the early school experience of some of our project members.

#### Origin I: the Story of W

In the early 1980s, W, a Chinese by ancestral origin, who was in his early teens, encountered the then legendary Apple II, and learned the Logo (turtle graphics) and BASIC programming languages, in a remote town S near Penang, Malaysia, which curiously hosted many multinational manufacturing plants, such as the big 4 -- Intel, HP, Motorola,  Bosch -- ever since the bygone Cold War period, perhaps as an technology outpost of the First World camp.

As such, like many little towns near Penang, the biggest international element in town S are perhaps the employees of these multinational corporations (MNC), and have since become a multi generational phenomenon. This was perhaps a crucial step in securing the loyalty of the Chinese Malaysians to the anti-Communist government, as throughout the 1950s to 1970s, many of the fathers, uncles and brothers of these same MNC employees were either directly involved in Communist armed forces or as sympathizers.

To W, the biggest international element in his life then, besides the programming languages that he learned, and an IBM PC XT clone made in Taiwan purchased with a significant portion of his family savings, was an out of print algebra text book written in English, printed in India, as was the earlier colonial practice, that was passed on to W via relatives.

Cold War historians might be interested in this period, as W was to live through the 1989 upheavals in China and Soviet Union, and later the birth of European Union, and voted in UK election that ushered in Tony Blair's premiership.

More curiously, W was amongst the first generation of students to study various subjects, including mathematics, in the secondary school in the Malay language, which became the primary instructional language not too long ago, as Malay centric nationalism demanded the government to switch from the original instructional language of English. Incidentally, the then rather young Dr Mahathir, a fellow townsman of W, had just become the Prime Minister of Malaysia, after serving as the Minister of Education for a short time.

Educationists and historians today may recall that it was Dr Mahathir who later reintroduce English as the instructional languages for science and mathematics subjects in schools and universities.

In hindsight, even W himself finds it difficult to explain his attraction to the algebra text book written in English, as he was struggling to learn English as a THIRD language, after completing primary education with instructional language in Chinese, and having to cope with learning Malay as the primary instructional language in the secondary school.

So W learned both English and algebra by reading the text book front to back, eventually acquiring knowledge concerning quadratic equations, geometric progression etc. without guidance from teachers at school, nor from his parents, who were not conversant in English.

_It was this unique experience that convince W that we really do not need officers at the Ministry of Education to tell us what and how to learn. Hence this project._
